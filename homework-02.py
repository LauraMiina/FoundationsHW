#Can you think of another approach to #7 and/or #8 that you could have tried? Why is yours better? If you could not get #7/#8 to work, use this question to explain what you were trying to do.
#I'm sure there is many better ones with less rows, but I'm already overwhelmed and cannot figure them out
#I think I could bring a table with the years and presidents and work with that, but don't know how
